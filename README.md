## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - For simple Cart store
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - For icons

### What I learned

In this project I was practicing development of responsive design. For the first time I implemented lightbox gallery and this was first project in which I used Tailwind CSS.

### Continued development

In future projects I will be focused on creating more flexible and universal React components. I think I also need to creating more components in my projets to split code more and by that making important componets more linear.
